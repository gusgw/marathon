# test_summary.sh: Summary of marathon testing capabilities

echo "Marathon Testing Suite Summary"
echo "=============================="
echo
echo "The marathon framework now includes comprehensive testing capabilities:"
echo

echo "1. TEST SCRIPTS AVAILABLE:"
echo "   • test_marathon.sh      - Full framework test suite"
echo "   • test_cleanup_modes.sh - Verifies all cleanup modes work correctly"
echo "   • test_performance.sh   - Performance and stress testing"
echo "   • test_retry.sh         - Retry mechanism verification"
echo "   • demo_cleanup.sh       - Quick demonstration of cleanup modes"
echo

echo "2. WHAT EACH TEST VERIFIES:"
echo
echo "   test_marathon.sh:"
echo "   - Directory structure creation"
echo "   - Metadata generation (manifest.json)"
echo "   - All cleanup modes (keep, output, gpg, all)"
echo "   - Resource monitoring (load, memory, free)"
echo "   - Health check functionality"
echo "   - Archive system operation"
echo "   - Retry mechanism"
echo "   - Transfer logging"
echo "   - Error tracking and reporting"
echo

echo "   test_cleanup_modes.sh:"
echo "   - Runs jobs with each cleanup mode"
echo "   - Verifies correct files are retained/removed"
echo "   - Shows detailed file listings for each mode"
echo "   - Confirms system logs always retained"
echo

echo "   test_performance.sh:"
echo "   - Parallel job execution"
echo "   - Memory usage tracking"
echo "   - Load average monitoring"
echo "   - Transfer performance logging"
echo "   - Concurrent job stress testing"
echo "   - Performance report generation"
echo

echo "   test_retry.sh:"
echo "   - Successful retry after failures"
echo "   - Retry exhaustion handling"
echo "   - Non-retryable error detection"
echo "   - Exponential backoff timing"
echo "   - Retry policy configuration"
echo "   - Rclone-specific retry wrapper"
echo "   - Error code classification"
echo

echo "3. HOW TO RUN TESTS:"
echo "   chmod +x test*.sh           # Make all tests executable"
echo "   ./test_marathon.sh          # Run full test suite"
echo "   ./test_cleanup_modes.sh     # Test cleanup modes"
echo "   ./test_performance.sh       # Run performance tests"
echo "   ./test_retry.sh            # Test retry mechanism"
echo

echo "4. VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY:"
echo "   ✓ Enhanced logging with date-based organization"
echo "   ✓ Job metadata generation with SHA256 checksums"
echo "   ✓ Performance tracking in CSV format"
echo "   ✓ Log archival with compression"
echo "   ✓ Health check endpoint (HTTP and CLI)"
echo "   ✓ Retry mechanism with exponential backoff"
echo "   ✓ Error tracking and failure logs"
echo "   ✓ All cleanup modes work as documented"
echo

echo "5. KEY IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "   • work/ directory remains as 'work/' (not renamed)"
echo "   • Full rclone compatibility with S3 and other backends"
echo "   • System metrics in dedicated date-organized directories"
echo "   • Comprehensive job tracking and reporting"
echo "   • Automatic daily summaries"
echo "   • Configurable log retention policies"
