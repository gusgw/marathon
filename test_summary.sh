# test_summary.sh - Overview and guide to Marathon's testing capabilities
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script provides a comprehensive overview of Marathon's testing
#   suite, explaining what each test does, how to run them, and what
#   functionality has been verified. It serves as documentation and a
#   quick reference for developers and operators.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./test_summary.sh
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
#   - Lists all available test scripts with descriptions
#   - Explains what each test verifies in detail
#   - Provides instructions for running tests
#   - Summarizes verified functionality
#   - Highlights key improvements in the framework
#
# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
#   - Structured documentation of testing capabilities
#   - No actual tests are run by this script
#   - Information-only output to help users understand testing
#   - Lists test scripts in order of comprehensiveness
#   - Shows checkmarks (✓) for verified features
#
# SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
#   - None - this is a documentation script only
#   - Test scripts should exist in the same directory
#
# NOTES:
#   - Use this as a starting point to understand Marathon testing
#   - Refer to individual test script headers for detailed info
#   - Run test_marathon.sh for comprehensive validation
#   - Run test_report.sh for a quick health check
