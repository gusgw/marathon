# Current State of Error Handling Issues in Marathon Scripts

This document reviews the current state of error handling issues identified in `error_handling_analysis.md` and notes which issues have been resolved and which remain.

## Summary of Changes

Based on the review of the current codebase:

1. **Significant improvements** have been made to error handling across all scripts
2. Most generic `$?` error codes have been replaced with standardized return codes
3. Additional dependency checks have been added
4. Direct echo to stderr has been mostly eliminated (except in cleanup.sh where it's acceptable)

## Detailed Analysis by File

### 1. run.sh

#### Issues RESOLVED ✓
- **Line 170 (was 157)**: Now uses `parallel_report "$?" "make folder if necessary"` but still generic
- **Line 207 (was 194)**: Now uses `parallel_report $? "ending test ${job}"` but still generic  
- **Line 211 (was 198)**: Now uses `parallel_report $? "waiting for run to finish"` but still generic
- **Dependency checks**: Added checks for `find`, `dd`, `mv`, `sleep`, `kill` (lines 77-81)
- **No direct exit usage**: Still good!

#### Issues REMAINING ✗
- **Generic error codes** still used in lines 170, 207, 211 - should use `SYSTEM_UNIT_FAILURE`
- **Missing dependency checks**:
  - `basename` (used implicitly in line 164)
  - `mkdir` (used in line 169)
  - `seq` (used in line 187)

### 2. settings.sh

#### Issues RESOLVED ✓
- **ALL error reporting now uses proper codes!**
  - Line 13: Uses `FILING_ERROR` for workspace creation
  - Line 26: Uses `FILING_ERROR` for log folder creation  
  - Line 27: Uses `FILING_ERROR` for status folder creation
  - Line 28-29: Uses `FILING_ERROR` for system metrics folders
  - Line 33-35: Uses `FILING_ERROR` for reports folders
  - Line 39: Uses `FILING_ERROR` for ramdisk setup
- **No direct echo to stderr**: Still good!

#### Issues REMAINING ✗
- **Missing dependency checks**:
  - `mkdir` command
  - `hostname` command
  - `date` command
  - `sed` command (used in line 45)

### 3. io.sh

#### Issues RESOLVED ✓
- **ALL network operations now use `NETWORK_ERROR`!**
  - Lines 32, 42, 53, 63: Download operations use `NETWORK_ERROR`
  - Lines 186, 196, 208, 218: Upload operations use `NETWORK_ERROR`
- **Direct echo removed**: Line 250 now uses `log_message` instead of direct echo

#### Issues REMAINING ✗
- **Missing dependency checks**:
  - `find` command (used in lines 89, 133)
  - `shopt` command (bash builtin - may not need checking)

### 4. aws.sh

#### Issues RESOLVED ✓
- **No changes needed** - Still uses generic `$?` on line 18 but this is acceptable for metadata checking

#### Issues REMAINING ✗
- **Line 18**: Could use `NETWORK_ERROR` or `SYSTEM_UNIT_FAILURE` instead of generic `$?`
- **Missing dependency checks**:
  - `ec2-metadata` command (line 17)
  - `curl` command (lines 21, 24)
  - `grep` command (line 27)

### 5. cleanup.sh

#### Issues RESOLVED ✓
- **ALL file operations now use `FILING_ERROR`!**
  - Lines 105, 108: Removing input files
  - Line 117: Removing raw output
  - Line 128: Removing encrypted files
  - Line 174: Sending logs uses `NETWORK_ERROR`
  - Line 177: Removing work folder uses `FILING_ERROR`
  - Line 183: Removing log folder uses `FILING_ERROR`
  - Line 227: Copying status files uses `FILING_ERROR`
- **Direct exit usage**: Still only in acceptable places (line 196 and shutdown)

#### Issues REMAINING ✗
- **Direct echo to stderr**: Still present but acceptable in cleanup context
- **Missing dependency checks**:
  - `chmod` command (line 64)
  - `cp` command (lines 63, 227)
  - `rm` command (used throughout)
  - `tar` command (line 167)
  - `sudo` command (line 194)

## Progress Summary

### Major Improvements
1. **settings.sh**: 100% converted to proper error codes
2. **io.sh**: 100% converted to proper error codes
3. **cleanup.sh**: 100% converted to proper error codes

### Still Needs Work
1. **run.sh**: 3 instances of generic error codes remain
2. **aws.sh**: 1 instance of generic error code (low priority)
3. **Missing dependency checks** across all files for common commands

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Fix remaining generic error codes in `run.sh` (3 instances)
2. Add dependency checks for critical commands like `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`

### Medium Priority
1. Fix generic error code in `aws.sh` 
2. Add dependency checks for AWS-specific commands

### Low Priority
1. Some commands may be bash built-ins (like `shopt`) and don't need checking
2. Direct echo in cleanup.sh is acceptable for final messages

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in standardizing error handling. The majority of issues have been resolved, with only a few generic error codes remaining in `run.sh` and some missing dependency checks across all files.
